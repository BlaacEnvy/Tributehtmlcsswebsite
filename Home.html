                        <h1>Priscilla Shirer</h1>
                        <p>I remember watching war room as teenager and that changed my life. 
                            At that age prayer was more of a ritual than a dialogue with God. 
                            But after watching war room something sparked in me, and I couldn't 
                            get this phenomenal woman out of my mind. With a few google searches I found 
                            out that her name was Priscilla Shirer. 
                            <br>I began following on social media , listening to her teaching and the 
                            more i did this the more inspired I got. By not only her preaching but also her
                            values, virtues and her firm faith in Jesus Christ. She is truly a diamond in a raft 
                            in generation where young girl need upright role models.</p>
